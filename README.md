**Notice: It is a legacy version for OS Monitor, please use it if you really want to use.**

OSMonitor is a small tool let you monitor your android phone.

- Process monitor all processes and display detail information about each.
- Network show every physical or logical network interface with statistics.
- Connection display every tcp or udp network connection, and query it via WHOIS ( require Google Map )
- Misc monitor processor, battery and file system.
- Log check dmesg or logcat in real-time.

P.S. I don't maintain this version anymore. :)
